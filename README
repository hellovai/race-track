The goal of this game is to move the car from S to F. "." are valid road spaces. Every move is -1. Going off road is -5, and you will ricochet off on the road depending on how you hit the road.

in the main directory run:
	cd game/
	make
	cd ../

usage
	./race-track <race-name> <starting e value> <number of games>

default is "race.dat" file
create a track based on that file

Notes:
	There is some learning that is happening, some results are in the results/ directory, however, it does not seem to be typical of montecarlo
